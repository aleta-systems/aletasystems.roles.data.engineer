### Ticket Number: INT-1000

**Goal**

>*As a* user

>*I want* all sales-events generated in `stage.sales_event_data` to be loaded into `sales.fact_sales_order`

>*So that* I can report on sales data.


**Background**

Our backend system `INSERTS` a JSON array of events into `stage.sales_event_data` periodically. The events are a collection of **Order's** placed. 

The structure is _well defined_ and static. 

**Single Event Structure:**

The below is the structure of a single event. 
```json
	{
		"order_date": "2019-07-07",
		"order_id": 1,
		"order_notes": "VUX22019 | Direct | Cutomer",
		"customer": [
			{
				"customer_id": 95,
				"customer_name": "Autumn Lam"
			}
		],
		"products": [
			{
				"product_id": 82,
				"product_name": "Admunewower",
				"order_quantity": 15
			}
		],
		"supplier": [
			{
				"supplier_id": 82,
				"supplier_name": "Barquestantor  "
			}
		]
	}
```

**Notes:** 
- There is **ONLY** one customer per order
- There is **ONLY** one supplier per order
- There are **ONE OR MANY** products per order
- All orders can be uniquely identified with `order_id`

**Scope**

* Loading the same `event_data` twice should not cause duplicates
* Load data **ONLY** into `sales.fact_sales_order`
* Dims are already populated and seeded

**Notes**

* Create a Stored Procedure `sales.usp_load_fact_sales_order`
* With a parameter `@event_id INT`
* You are **ALLOWED** to use an alternate to stored-procedures but you must document how to use it.

**Evaluation Questions**

* Can I use any tool/process : *Yes*
* Does it matter what tool/process I use: *Ideally we like to see stored-procs but you are free and will be evaluated.*
